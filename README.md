# TimeKeeper
this app resides on the top of all other screens so that you can see clearly your Timer, Stopwatch, Alarm or Clock

set a timer/stopwatch/alarm, and as you are working, the countdown will stay in the foreground so that it doesn't disapear.

designed in mind for training videos or as a general clock

still need to implement nicer graphics, sounds and animations
